<h1><b>Troubleshooting/FAQ</b></h1>
<h3><i>The Map doesn't move/points in the wrong place</i></h3>Make sure you haven't switched into manual mode. Does your phone have a compass? If not, Sky Map cannot tell your orientation. Look it up <a href=" http://www.gsmarena.com/ ">here:</a> http://www.gsmarena.com/ <br />
Try calibrating your compass by moving it in a figure of 8 motion or as described <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1EPbAapaeI">here:</a> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1EPbAapaeI. <br />
Are there any magnets or metal nearby that might interfere with the compass? <br />
Try switching off "magnetic correction" (in settings) and see if that is more accurate.

<h3><i>Why is autolocation not supported for my phone?</i></h3>In Android 6 the way permissions work has changed. You need to enable the location permission setting for Sky Map as described <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/6270602?p=app_permissons_m">here:</a> https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/6270602?p=app_permissons_m

<h3><i>The Map is jittery</i></h3> If you have a phone that lacks a gyro then some jitter is to be expected. Try adjusting the sensor speed and damping (in settings).

<h3><i>Do I need an internet connection?<i></h3> No, but some functions (like entering your location manually) won't work without one. You'll have to use the GPS or enter a latitude and longitude instead.
