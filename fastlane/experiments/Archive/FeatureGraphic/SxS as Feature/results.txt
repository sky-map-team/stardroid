# Description
This swapped out the 'feature' graphic to include a screenshot from the app
side by size with a photograph of the corresponding sky. The base is
the old picture of a nebula with "Sky Map" on it.


## Result
After 6 days the CI still included 'no effect'

-21.9%
+11.3%

...but it didn't look like it was going to end positively.  Since we can only
run one experiment at a time, stop this one and potentially revisit later.
