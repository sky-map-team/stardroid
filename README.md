Sky Map is the open-source astronomy Android app built for the community.  You can download the official builds from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.stardroid) or from [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.google.android.stardroid/).

## FAQ
### Is this *Google* Sky Map?
It was originally! 

Sky Map has a *long* history, launching as Google Sky Map on the very first Android phone at Searchology 2009. In 2011 Google ceased active support and the original developers open-sourced it with Google's permission.  Google's [Open Source Programs Office](https://opensource.org/blog/google-ospo-why-we-support-the-osi) kindly allowed us to continue to work on it as a personal project, provided we removed Google's branding from it and did not use Google's resources. Today it is still maintained by the same folks. While we no longer work for Google we continue to develop Sky Map using our own resources.

#### Then what is stardroid?
"Stardroid" was the internal name - you can see it's still used as an identifier in the code. Back in the day Google's lawyercats were concerned that 'stardroid' might attract the wrath of, let's say, followers of the Dark Side of the Force so we were _strongly_ encouraged not to call it that. Plus, Google likes to name products after what they are (Photos, Calendar, Docs...). So, Sky Map it is.

### Why does it lack feature _X_ or look so dated?
Android has evolved significantly since 2009. While most of the code has been rewritten since its Google days, the architecture reflects its origins. We are currently working on a complete modernization of the app. In the meantime, we are continually inspired by the community of users who still find joy in its simplicity and quirks.

### How can we help?
I'm glad you asked! We have a section on that below.
