# Review instructions

## What Important means here

Reserve Important for findings that would break behavior, leak data,
or block a rollback: incorrect logic, unscoped database queries, PII
in logs or error messages, and migrations that aren't backward
compatible. Style, naming, and refactoring suggestions are Nit at
most.

## Cap the nits

Report at most five Nits per review.

## Do not report

- Anything CI already enforces: lint, formatting, type errors
- Generated files under `src/gen/` and any `*.lock` file
- Test-only code that intentionally violates production rules

## Always check

- New API routes have an integration test
- Log lines don't include email addresses, user IDs, or request bodies
- Database queries are scoped to the caller's tenant
