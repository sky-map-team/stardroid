&lt;h2&gt;Introduction and Quick Start&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sky Map is your catalog of the night sky! Point your Android-powered device up, and you will see a map of the brightest stars, constellations, and planets in that part of the sky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Visible Layers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sky Map organizes the objects it shows you into layers. Each layer can be toggled using the on-screen controls. The layers are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stars&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Constellations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Messier Objects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Planets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meteor Showers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right Ascension and Declination Grid&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Horizon and cardinal points&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brightest stars, constellations, and planets are labeled. Planets display as images that are larger than they will appear in the sky. Sky Map may show objects that are above the horizon line (represented as a straight line) that you may not be able to see, unless you live in an area that is flat and without buildings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;On-screen Controls&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tap on the screen to show the on-screen controls. On one side of the screen are the toggles for the layers described above. They are orange when the layers are enabled and white when disabled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other side of the screen has a toggle to switch between automatic and manual mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Navigation Modes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When first installed Sky Map will be in Automatic Mode and will use the phone\'s sensors to display a map of the sky in the direction your phone is pointing. By switching into Manual Mode, you can drag the map with your finger to explore the sky. You can also rotate the map with two fingers and use a pinch gesture to zoom in and out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Search&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sky Map helps answer the question \'What star is that?\' or \'Where is ...?\' Access the search function through the phone\'s menu button or through the Quick Search Box directly on the Desktop. Enter the name of the star, constellation, or planet you wish to find, and Sky Map will list the matching search items. Select one and Sky Map will display a targeting circle and an arrow prompting you where to point the phone to find the object. The circle will change from blue to red, finally turning orange when the object is within your field of view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE: If you are in Manual Mode, Sky Map will simply move the map to show you the object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To exit Search Mode, tap the small cross in the corner of the screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Time Travel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time Travel mode enables you to use Sky Map to see the sky at times other than the present. Select \'Time Travel\' from the main menu, and then select one of the Popular Dates or choose your own date and time using the \'Change the Date\' and \'Change the Time\' dialogs. Selections are restricted to the years 1900-2100 due to limitations on accuracy caused mainly by the gravitational influence of Jupiter. When you\'re done, press \'Go!\' to fly through time to your destination. Your Sky Map is now in time travel mode, displaying the date you\'re visiting, with controls for \'playing\' time forwards and backwards from here. Click these buttons once to start moving slowly through time, and several times to travel faster and faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time Travel can be used to answer a variety of questions, including \'What will I be able to see just after sunset this evening?\', \'When will I next have a good chance of seeing Mercury?\', and \'According to Hesiod, when should I harvest my grapes?\'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Hubble Gallery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sky Map contains a gallery of images from the Hubble telescope. Access the Gallery by selecting the Gallery item in the menu. Once inside the Gallery, you can browse the available images by scrolling with your finger. If you tap one of the thumbnail images, Sky Map shows you the full size image. If you tap the Search button, Sky Map will switch to Search mode to find the object matching the image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Night Vision Mode&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Night Vision Mode is designed to protect your dark-adapted eyes. When you select the Night Vision menu option, Sky Map will display the map in a red color, dim the screen and switch off the button backlights. Select the option again to revert to normal colors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Setting Your Location&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sky Map needs your approximate location in order to show you the correct star map. By default, it will determine this from your cellular network. If you are out of range, or have network location disabled it will use your phone\'s GPS. You can also set your location manually via the settings menu, either by supplying a place name or as a latitude and longitude (in degrees.) Note that Sky Map requires a data connection to determine your latitude and longitude from a place name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Troubleshooting and Limitations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The map is inaccurate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you find that the map does not accurately line up with the real sky there could be a number of reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is your compass calibrated? Try holding the phone and rotating your wrist in figures of eight to calibrate it. You may need to repeat this at intervals - this is a feature of the phone, rather than Sky Map.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the application have an accurate fix on your location? Is your GPS or network location turned on?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you have the correct time and timezone set? Sky Map needs to calculate Universal Time, and it needs your local time AND timezone to do this. If your device has a SIM card then these will usually be set correctly. Open Sky Map\'s diagnostics page to check that time and location are correct.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you have magnetic correction switched on? In some parts of the world the difference between magnetic North and True North can be as much as 20 degrees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The map does not move&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you in manual mode? If not, this could be due to an uncalibrated compass. Follow the steps above to \'unstick\' it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does your phone have all the necessary sensors? Not all phones do. It must have at least a compass and an accelerometer and ideally a gyroscope. Sky Map\'s Diagnostics page will show which sensors you have. If your phone does not have a gyro, try selecting \'Disable gyro\' in Settings/Sensor Settings(experts).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p class="callout"&gt;If all else fails, send us an email (preferably with a screenshot of your Diagnostics page) and we\'ll help you figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Telescope Users&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sky Map now includes a prototype \'Pointer Mode\' where the screen will show not what is in front of the phone, but what you would see if you sighted along the long edge of it. The purpose is so that you can attach your phone to your telescope tube and have the screen perpendicular to the direction of the tube. You can enable this in \'settings\' under \'sensor settings\'.&lt;/p&gt;
