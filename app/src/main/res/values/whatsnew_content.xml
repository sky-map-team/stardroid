<h2>Celestial Images</h2>
    Info cards now include photographs for all 145 objects — planets, stars, constellations, and Messier objects. Tap any object to explore it visually.

<h2>New Catalog Objects</h2>
    T Coronae Borealis (the "Blaze Star") and the Eta Carinae Nebula are now in the catalog.

<h2>Night Mode</h2>
    Red night mode now covers nearly all UI elements, including all dialogs and the compass calibration screen — no more blinding white flashes in the dark.

<h2>New Messier Object Icons</h2>
    Deep sky objects now display distinct icons based on their type: galaxies, open clusters, globular clusters, diffuse nebulae, planetary nebulae, and supernova remnants.

<h2>Info Cards in Automatic Mode</h2>
    You can now optionally enable info cards while using sensor-based pointing. Look for the new setting in Preferences to turn this on.

<h2>Compass Calibration Help</h2>
    A new troubleshooting guide explains why compasses go wrong and how to fix them. You can also set a manual compass offset if needed.

<h2>Time Travel Events</h2>
    The Time Travel dialog now includes meteor showers and new moon events, and will automatically search for those with a visible target in the sky.

<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>
    The Moon\'s illuminated crescent now renders at the correct angle by properly accounting for Earth\'s axial tilt.
    Fixed an issue where content could be obscured by navigation bars on devices not using gesture navigation.

    A Credits screen is now accessible from the main menu, recognizing the contributors and <a href="https://buymeacoffee.com/skymapdevs">supporters</a> of Sky Map.
