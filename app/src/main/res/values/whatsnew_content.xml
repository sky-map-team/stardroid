<h2>New Messier Object Icons</h2>
    Deep sky objects now display distinct icons based on their type: galaxies, open clusters, globular clusters, diffuse nebulae, planetary nebulae, and supernova remnants. No more guessing what you\'re looking at!

<h2>Info Cards in Automatic Mode</h2>
    You can now optionally enable info cards while using sensor-based pointing. Look for the new setting in Preferences to turn this on.

<h2>Moon Phase Angle Fix</h2>
    The Moon\'s illuminated crescent now renders at the correct angle by properly accounting for Earth\'s axial tilt.

<h2>Edge-to-Edge Display Fix</h2>
    Fixed an issue where content could be obscured by navigation bars on devices using gesture navigation.

<h2>Messier Catalog Improvements</h2>
    Corrected data for several Messier objects and improved how object types are categorized.

<h2>Compass Calibration Help</h2>
    A new troubleshooting guide explains why compasses go wrong and how to fix it. You can also set a manual compass offset if needed.

<h2>Time Travel Events</h2>
    The Time Travel dialog now includes meteor showers and new moon events, and will automatically search for those with a visible target in the sky.

<h2>Credits</h2>
    A Credits screen is now accessible from the main menu, recognizing the contributors and <a href="https://buymeacoffee.com/skymapdevs">supporters</a> of Sky Map.

<h2>Time Travel UX</h2>
    A new "Start from Now" button makes it easy to enter time travel from the current moment. Once you pick an event or change the date, it switches to "Go!" so it\'s clear where you\'re headed.
