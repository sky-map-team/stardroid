<h2>New Messier Object Icons</h2>
    Deep sky objects now display distinct icons based on their type: galaxies, open clusters, globular clusters, diffuse nebulae, planetary nebulae, and supernova remnants. No more guessing what you\'re looking at!

<h2>Info Cards in Automatic Mode</h2>
    You can now optionally enable info cards while using sensor-based pointing. Look for the new setting in Preferences to turn this on.

<h2>Moon Phase Angle Fix</h2>
    The Moon\'s illuminated crescent now renders at the correct angle by properly accounting for Earth\'s axial tilt.

<h2>Edge-to-Edge Display Fix</h2>
    Fixed an issue where content could be obscured by navigation bars on devices using gesture navigation.

    Corrected data for several Messier objects and improved how object types are categorized.

<h2>Expanded Translations</h2>

  <li>Info cards now available in German, Japanese, Dutch, and Polish</li>
