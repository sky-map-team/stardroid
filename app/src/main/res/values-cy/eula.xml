    <h2>Crynodeb</h2>
    Daw Sky Map gyda dim gwarantau na sicrwydd!
	<br/><br/>
    Os fyddwch yn dewis defnyddio\'r ap i hwylio\'r moroedd mawr ac yn taro tir neu fynydd iâ, 
	eich cyfrifoldeb chi yw hi. Os dywedwch wrth eich plant mae Sadwrn yw\'r peth disglair yn yr
	awyr ac mae\'n dod i\'r amlwg mai UFO sy\'n dod i\'ch cipio chi - nid ein cyfrifoldeb ni.
	Os yw\'ch plant o ganlyniad yn methu â chyflwyno eu gwaith cartref a\'n eu cosbi gan eu 
	hathro gwyddoniaeth - dim ein bai ni. Os yw\'r ap yn dileu\'r holl ddata ar eich ffôn, gan
	gynnwys y lluniau o\'r UFO oedd am ddod â chyfoeth i chi a\'ch teulu - dim ein cyfrifoldeb 
	ni. Os yw\'n achosi eich ffôn i rwygo twll yn ffabrig gofod ac amser - digon teg, cymerwn 
	y bai. Unrhyw drychineb arall - dim bai na chyfrifoldeb o gwbl arnom ni. Peidiwch â 
	defnyddio\'r ap wrth yrru neu ddefnyddio siswrn.

    Mae fersiwn cyfreithiol diflas isod. Yn yr iaith fain, sori.

    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    This App uses Google Analytics to help analyse how people use it.
    Google Analytics collects standard internet log information and visitor behaviour information
    in an anonymous form. Note that the data is anonymous - no personally identifiable information
    is collected.  This anonymous information
    is transmitted to Google – not the Sky Map developers. Google Analytics then compiles
    statistical reports that tell us things like the percentage of users that use certain features,
    have particular versions of Android or have phones that have certain features (such as a gyroscope).
    This is essential for us to discover which features
    people like and dislike and when we can drop support for obsolete versions of Android
    and thus make Sky Map better.  We might share these reports with third parties.<br/>
    We respect your privacy and do not collect your personal information - we cannot tell anything about
    you as a user. If you do not
    wish to share this anonymous data with Google Analytics you can opt out via the settings menu.
    Otherwise, thank you for helping make Sky Map better. For more information on
    Google Analytics see  https://www.google.com/analytics/
