## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please email us at **[skymapdevs@gmail.com](mailto:skymapdevs@gmail.com)** with:

- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce or a proof of concept
- The potential impact

We will acknowledge your email and work with you to understand and address the issue. Please allow a reasonable amount of time for us to respond — as a volunteer-maintained project, it might take a few days.

## Scope

Security concerns for Sky Map include:

- **Privacy and sensor data** — Sky Map accesses device sensors (accelerometer, magnetometer, gyroscope) and location. Any vulnerability that could lead to unintended data exposure is in scope.
- **Dependency vulnerabilities** — Issues in third-party libraries used by the app.
- **APK integrity** — Concerns about the integrity of distributed builds.

## Out of Scope

- Vulnerabilities in the Android OS itself
- Issues requiring physical access to an unlocked device
- Social engineering attacks
